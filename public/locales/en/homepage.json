		"text": "The Department of Machining and Assembly (DMA) deals with machining metallic and non-metallic materials' theoretical and practical aspects. It also focuses on optimizing the cutting process in terms of a cutting tool, machined material, and cutting conditions during turning, milling, drilling, and grinding. The research focuses on machining tools and processes, which it analyzes in terms of machinability, optimization, and process fluids."
