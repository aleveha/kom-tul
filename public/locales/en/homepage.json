		"text": "The Department of Machining and Assembly deals mainly with machining of\u00a0metallic and non-metallic materials, designing and metrology. It also focuses on the optimization of\u00a0the\u00a0cutting process in terms of\u00a0the \u00a0cutting tool, the material to be machined and the cutting conditions in turning, milling, drilling and grinding. The research focuses on machine tools and processes, which he analyses in terms of\u00a0machinability, optimisation and the use of\u00a0process fluids."
